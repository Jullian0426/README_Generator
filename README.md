# README Generator

  ## Description

  This project allows for a README.md file to be automatically generated based on user input. This allows for less time spent on writing a quality README. I became more familiar with Node.js, Inquirer, and Fs.
  
  
  ## Installation: 

  In the command terminal, navigate to the README_Generator folder and type:

  `npm init`

  `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`

  ## Usage: 

  Run `node index.js` in the terminal.
